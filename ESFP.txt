ESFP - Extroverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving


Entertainers are bold, fun-loving people who live in the moment. They have excellent aesthetics and people skills, easily chatting with wit and charm. Entertainers are observant and sensitive, but also conflict-averse and easily bored. They are poor long-term planners who seek constant excitement.

In relationships, Entertainers bring freshness and energy. They reevaluate often based on feelings, not future plans. Entertainers need maturity to work on relationships versus leaving when novelty fades. As friends, they make life exciting but may exhaust one personâ€™s adventure.

As parents, Entertainers encourage children's wonder and exploration. But they struggle with discipline and rules. Career-wise, Entertainers thrive in roles engaging people like event planning, sales, and counseling. They loathe routine administrative work. Entertainers mirror others' moods well.

At work, Entertainers relax the environment and unite teams. But they need freedom from strict schedules. In summary, Entertainers are charming risk-takers who live in the now, but need to develop commitment and discipline.
