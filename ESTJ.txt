ESTJ - Extroverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging

Executives are representatives of tradition and order who utilize their understanding of right and wrong to provide direction. They have a strong sense of duty and lead by example, exemplifying hard work and rejection of laziness. Executives create structure and clear roles, and expect their reliability to be reciprocated.

In relationships, Executives are forthright from the start and unlikely to fundamentally change over time. They bring enthusiasm to activities with their partner. However, Executives can damage sensitive partners with bluntness and difficulty expressing emotion.

As parents, Executives are strict guardians of tradition who expect respect and contribution from their children. But adolescents' rebelliousness challenges Executives' inflexibility. Career-wise, Executives progress along clear paths in organized environments like law, military, and management. They are loyal employees who rise with consistent dedication.

At work, Executives follow rules and ensure high standards are met. As managers, they defend their teams yet may micromanage. In summary, Executives are practical, dutiful stabilizers of order yet can be rigid and insensitive.
